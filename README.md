### Veo Task

Review the current live [Veo homepage](https://veo.world):

- [x] Design (using tools of your choice) an updated version of the homepage. Document the reasons for any changes.
- [] Develop a simple html/css page based on the design in step 1.

Tasks notes:

- Design must be sent over in PDF format, but can be designed in any tool you prefer.
- The code may be sent via email in an archive file, or uploaded to a public git repository and a link sent via email.
- HTML/CSS Pre-Processors are allowed but must be compiled before being sent for review (for example you may use SASS/SCSS, but also include the compiled CSS file).
- There is no strict time limit, but please donâ€™t spend more than a couple of hours on this task. We are more interested in how you approach the tasks versus the final outcome.
