### Veo Task

Review the current live [Veo homepage](https://veo.world):

- [x] Design (using tools of your choice) an updated version of the homepage. Document the reasons for any changes.
- [x] Develop a simple html/css page based on the design in step 1.

Tasks notes:

- Design must be sent over in PDF format, but can be designed in any tool you prefer.
- The code may be sent via email in an archive file, or uploaded to a public git repository and a link sent via email.
- HTML/CSS Pre-Processors are allowed but must be compiled before being sent for review (for example you may use SASS/SCSS, but also include the compiled CSS file).
- There is no strict time limit, but please donâ€™t spend more than a couple of hours on this task. We are more interested in how you approach the tasks versus the final outcome.

#### Reasons for the changes:

- General design changes: I have used a more direct and minimalistic style for all the look of the page. I kept brand colors but changed primary font to [Karla](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Karla) because I find this font family more user friendly and less common than Open Sans.
- Navigation: I have removed the search bar to make navigation bar more cleaner, search functionality will be there although when you click on the search icon.
- I have changed the icons package to some ones that are more up to date with current design trends. The icons from company values were placed as simple icons for development speed and prototyping reasons.
- I have removed some sections that link to other pages and show them in the navigation menu. I find this better as you will always have the option to go to different pages without having to scroll down the page.
- I have highlighted the recommendations section because I think it is important in order to capture the user's attention in these products.
- I have changed the way we display all products. Grouping them by it's respective categories. This way the user don't have to scroll down to see different products, it will be easier for them only to select the category they are interested on.
- Product image shows like and shopping cart icon on hover. This way we can save a bit of space in the page and I think it's a nice feature.
